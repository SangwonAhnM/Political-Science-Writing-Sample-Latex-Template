  abstract = {This study aims to verify the microfoundation of mass polarization. In particular, it shows that partisan bias leads to growing consistency between voters partisanship and political attitudes by making them form their attitudes on the basis of their partisan consideration. Previous theories have been presenting the aggregate-level evidences of growing consistency between voters partisan preferences and political attitudes and claiming that ideological realignment and/or partisan sorting were revealed by bringing voters party loyalties into line with their ideology/policy preferences. Therefore, they theorize that mass polarization arises from partisans political attitudes moving toward their partisanship. This process assumes rational voters who can have their rational political attitudes. This aggregate-level perspective, however, tends to overlook the mechanism behind polarization how the consistency between partisanship and political attitudes grows. To be more specific, previous studies pay little attention to political properties of voters decision making because they deduce individual political attitudes from the political phenomenon of aggregate-level. This study argues that the mass response to the new political issue might be characterized not by the traditional account of displacement or the more recent term of realignment, but by conflict extension. This conflict extension enhances the existing structure of partisan conflict and plays a role as a political circumstance for partisan voters. Meanwhile, empirical studies have found voters partisan bias which hinder them from judging political matters objectively. Partisan voters, therefore, are not rational voters, but rationalizing voters who make a political decision based on partisan consideration. So they can show conformable political attitudes such as policy preferences and ideological proximity to their partisan preferences. For this reason, this study contends that partisan-biased attitudes in the circumstance of conflict extension are the key factors to give rise to mass polarization which has been recognized as growing consistency between partisanship and political attitudes. Considering this partisan bias, retrospective voting can hardly act as reward-punishment for the incumbents political performance to improve accountability and responsiveness of representative democracy. Empirical findings show that partisan voters have consistent policy attitudes in accordance with their partisan preferences. Contrary to the previous researches which understood this consistency in the policy preferences as a rational and desirable property, this study examines that consistent policy attitudes occurs as a result of voters partisan bias. On top of that, partisan voters reveal partisan-biased ideological proximity to the parties and the candidates. This result which is connected to the causal relationship between ideology and partisan preferences implies that partisan-biased proximity is much more plausible than partisan preferences to the ideologically close party. To end with, partisan voters expose partisan bias through trust in government and retrospective voting. The findings show that voters who are indifferent to major parties made vote decisions affected by governmental trust, while voters who have lopsided partisan preferences remain unaffected. These results mean that voters governmental trust and its effect on retrospective vote choice are significantly depending on their partisan preferences. Partisan bias which leads to partisan vote choice regardless of voters trust in government implies that a large portion of voters who do not support the ruling party may practically distrust incumbent government. In conclusion, this study verifies voters partisan bias, and therefore it leads to mass polarization as the individual-level mechanism. Compared with a considerable body of previous researches which have mainly described the phenomenon of mass polarization from the aggregate-level, this study attempts to explain how partisan bias influences mass polarization with focus on individual-level of political decision making. In addition to these empirical results, this study points out the fundamental factor which brings about the crisis of representative democracy. Recently, a growing number of independents have been known as a sign of the crisis of democracy. Contrary to this statement, this study argues that partisan voters may give rise to the crisis by intensifying political polarization and undermining the function of retrospective voting. To sum up, it contributes to our understanding of mass polarization which stems from partisan bias and its implications for representative democracy.},

  abstract = {This study examines how the perceptions of partisan polarization fuel interparty animus in South Korea. Although previous work suggests ideological differences between parties play a significant role in affective polarization, how voters perceive these differences and form attitudes based on them is largely unknown. This study focused on the subjective perceptions of partisan polarization and their consequence for attitudes towards parties. This study finds that people misperceive greater differences in political views between parties than they really are. This distortion was largely driven by overestimating the ideological extremity of the opposing party. Furthermore, the perceived polarization amplifies the affectively polarized attitudes by influencing partisans to evaluate the supporting party more positively and the opposing party more negatively. As to the bias towards out-partisans, only the characteristic evaluations showed a limited effect of the perceived polarization. Lastly, the effect of the perceived party extremity on the attitude toward the party differed depending on the partisanship. This study contributes to the understanding of partisan polarization by showing the gap between the perceived polarization and the actual polarization of Korean voters in detail, which has not been addressed so far, and by presenting empirical evidence that the perception of polarization is exaggerated asymmetrically by partisan bias. Also, it sheds light on the role and importance of subjective perception of polarization by revealing that an individual's perception of polarization is associated with attitudes toward political parties and partisans.},
