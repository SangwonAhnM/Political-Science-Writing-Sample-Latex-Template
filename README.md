This writing sample is prepared for my graduate school application in political science, based on the APSR submission template. As a Korean student, I utilize BibLaTeX because my writing sample includes references to Korean-language sources. To handle this, I have added "[In Korean]" at the end of the printed references. Although APSR citation guidelines suggest placing this label at the end of the title field along with romanized characters, the implementation process is quite complex. Therefore, I adopted a simpler rule for consistency. If needed, this can be modified upon request.

Additionally, I made the titles in the bibliography clickable, providing direct access if a DOI or URL is available. This feature is particularly helpful for non-Korean readers who wish to verify the sources. I manage all citations using Zotero, and the references are exported through the Better BibLaTeX extension.
